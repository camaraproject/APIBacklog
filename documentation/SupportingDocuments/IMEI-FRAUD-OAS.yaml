    # Summary

    The IMEI Fraud Check API allows clients to verify the status of mobile devices using their IMEI (International Mobile Equipment Identity) across three operator-managed registers: allowed lists, prohibited lists, and tracked lists.

    This API is useful for various scenarios:
     - Device registration and network access control
     - Insurance claims validation - verify if a claimed lost/stolen device is actually prohibited
     - Device purchase verification - check if a second-hand device has a clean status
     - Fraud prevention - detect potentially fraudulent devices before service activation
     - Compliance with regulatory requirements for device management
     - Network monitoring and tracking of specific devices

    # Introduction

    The International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) is a unique identifier assigned to mobile devices by manufacturers. This 15-digit number serves as a fingerprint for each device and is used by mobile networks to identify equipment on their networks.

    Mobile operators maintain three distinct registers for IMEI management:

    ## Register Types

    ### Allowed List (White List)
    Contains all number series of equipment identities that are permitted for use on the network. Devices on this list are explicitly authorized for network access.

    ### Prohibited List (Black List)
    Contains all equipment identities that belong to equipment that must be barred from network access. This includes devices that are:
    - **Lost**: Device reported missing by the subscriber
    - **Stolen**: Device reported stolen by the subscriber or law enforcement
    - **Blacklisted**: Device blocked due to fraud, non-payment, or other policy violations
    - **Blocked**: Device restricted from network access for regulatory or technical reasons

    ### Tracked List (Gray List)
    Contains equipment identities that are monitored by the network for evaluation or other purposes. Devices on the tracked list are not barred from network access (unless they are also on the prohibited list or not on the allowed list), but their network activity is logged and monitored.

    The use of these registers is at the operators' discretion, and the specific implementation may vary between different network operators and jurisdictions.

    # Relevant terms and definitions

    ### IMEI Fraud Check API service endpoint
    The URL pointing to the RESTful resource of the IMEI Fraud Check API.

    ### International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI)
    A unique 15-digit identifier assigned to mobile devices by the manufacturer, used to identify the device on mobile networks.

    ### Register Status
    The classification of a device based on its presence in operator-maintained registers (allowed, prohibited, tracked lists).

    ### Device Status
    The operational status of a device on the network, determined by evaluating its presence across all applicable registers.

    # API functionality

    The API defines one primary service endpoint:

    - `POST /check-status` to verify the register and operational status of a device using its IMEI

    To call this endpoint, the API consumer must first obtain a valid access token from the token endpoint, which is then passed as an Authorization header. The API consumer must provide the IMEI of the device to be checked in the request body.

    If the request is valid, the API response is a JSON object containing the device status and register information:
    - The response will always contain `imei` and `operationalStatus`.
    - A `lastChecked` field indicates when the information was last verified
    - If the device has a negative status, `reportedDate` and `prohibitedReason` may be included if available
    - Other response parameters are implementation dependent

    An example of a JSON response object is as follows:
    ```
    {
       "lastChecked": "2024-02-20T10:41:38.657Z",
       "imei": "490154203237518",
       "operationalStatus": "prohibited",
       "prohibitedReason": "stolen",
       "reportedDate": "2023-05-23T21:48:42.000Z"
    }
    ```

    ## Status Determination Logic

    The operational status is determined based on register presence:
    1. If the device is on the **prohibited list**: status is "prohibited" (regardless of other lists)
    2. If the device is on the **allowed list** and not on prohibited list: status is "allowed"
    3. If the device is only on the **tracked list**: status is "tracked"
    4. If the device is not on any list: status is "unknown"

    ## Error handling

    Errors may be returned for the following reasons. Note that this list is not exhaustive.

    `401 UNAUTHENTICATED`:
    - The access token is not a valid access token for the API provider
    - The access token was valid but has now expired

    `400 INVALID_ARGUMENT`:
    - The API request is not compliant with this OAS definition
    - Invalid IMEI format provided

    `400 OUT_OF_RANGE`:
    - A parameter value in the API request is outside the documented range

    `404 IDENTIFIER_NOT_FOUND`:
    - The IMEI provided in the request is not found in any accessible database

    `403 PERMISSION_DENIED`:
    - The access token does not have the required scope for the endpoint being called

    `422 SERVICE_NOT_APPLICABLE`:
    - The IMEI fraud check service cannot be applied to the provided identifier

    `429 QUOTA_EXCEEDED`:
    - The API consumer has exceeded their allocated quota for this API

    `429 TOO_MANY_REQUESTS`:
    - The rate limit for API requests has been exceeded

    ### Additional CAMARA error responses

    The list of error codes in this API specification is not exhaustive. Therefore the API specification may not document some non-mandatory error statuses as indicated in `CAMARA API Design Guide`.

    Please refer to the `CAMARA_common.yaml` of the Commonalities Release associated to this API version for a complete list of error responses. The applicable Commonalities Release can be identified in the `API Readiness Checklist` document associated to this API version.

    As a specific rule, error `501 - NOT_IMPLEMENTED` can be only a possible error response if it is explicitly documented in the API.

    ## Authorization and authentication

    The "Camara Security and Interoperability Profile" provides details of how an API consumer requests an access token. Please refer to Identity and Consent Management (https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/) for the released version of the profile.

    The specific authorization flows to be used will be agreed upon during the onboarding process, happening between the API consumer and the API provider, taking into account the declared purpose for accessing the API, whilst also being subject to the prevailing legal framework dictated by local legislation.
