| API family name | high-throughput elastic networks API |
| API family owner | China Mobile |
| API summary | This API provides scheduling ability of huge data transmission in network. It can calculate load-balancing paths automatically with given time duration, total data amount and bandwidth limit, and satisfy huge data transmission requirements with dynamic and elastic bandwidth allocation algorithms, tidal-traffic-aware segment list adjustment and SRv6 multiple segment list technology.<br /><br />This API is designed for large enterprises requiring efficient network bandwidth management. It dynamically adjusts and optimizes bandwidth utilization to handle high-volume data transmission scenarios such as video conferences, large file transfers, and cloud resource access. By leveraging advanced technologies, it ensures seamless and efficient data flow across different time periods. This API is ideal for organizations that need robust solutions to manage substantial data transfers, ensuring high performance and reliability in demanding network environments.<br/>This API is suitable for customers in industries with massive data transfer requirements, such as Cross-cloud backup, model training at intelligent compute centers, video editing, and scientific computing. For example, the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST), located in GuiZhou province of China, could generate more than 10 PB of observational data per year. By calling this API, users can dynamically adjust bandwidth and elastically orchestrate network resources according to their specific requirements for bandwidth, latency, and file size. This capability facilitates the efficient and expedient transmission of large observational datasets within short timeframes. In subsequent applications of the API, developers can set multiple groups of input parameters as standard configuration files, enabling quick selection and application.<br /><br />Input:<br/>1.

| Uniqueness |The API stands out for its advanced network bandwidth management, designed to dynamically optimize and adjust bandwidth utilization. Targeted at large enterprises, it handles high-volume data transmissions such as video conferences, large file transfers, and cloud resource access. This API leverages UCMP or ECMP capabilities implemented by srv6 technology, placing it within the IP bearer network field. Unlike NetworkSlicing, QoD, and DedicatedNetwork APIs, which rely on wireless professional slicing and SLA guarantee technologies, this API provides a unique solution for robust and reliable high-throughput needs in enterprise environments.|
| Technical viability | This API leverages the IETF RFC8402 Segment Routing Architecture and RFC8986 SR Multi-SEGment Multi-Complexity Balancing technology based on SR Network Programming Segment Routing over IPv6 (SR) Network Programming and RFC6241 Network Configuration Protocol Protocol (NETCONF) adjusts QoS technology in real time to achieve the availability of high-throughput, high-bandwidth APIs. |
| Commercial viability | IP high-throughput elastic web application APIs have been commercialized in many fields. Help operators monetize their variable bandwidth needs. High-throughput and high-bandwidth capabilities have great potential for market applications in the future, and are particularly important in scientific and technological research, astronomical meteorology, data backup, film and television editing and other scenarios, scientific research and other fields, and many commercial scenarios have emerged. |
