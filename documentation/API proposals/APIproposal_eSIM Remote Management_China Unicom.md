| API summary                               | Provide eSIM-based remote management capability, allowing users to remotely manage the status of profiles on the device's eUICC and complete remote operations such as downloading, activating, de-activating or deleting. <br><br>Input:<br>1.IMEI:International Mobile Equipment Identity<br>2.EIDeUICC identification code<br>3.ICCIDIC Card Identification, uniquely identifies a Profile code number data<br>4.MSISDNMobile Station International Subscriber Directory Number<br>4.AC(optional)activation code,its mandatory when downloading profile<br>5.Type Of Operation:downloading, activation, deactivation,deletion<br><br>Output:<br>Operation Result|     |
| Technical viability                       | Based on the RSP specifications of GSMA, eSIM terminals can communicate with the SM DP+ through LPA, download profiles to the eUICC, and the business platforms can remotely manage the profiles already downloaded to the eUICC. |     |
| Commercial viability                      | Reducing the cost of using SIM cards for IoV devices and IoH devices and improving mobile network access for terminal devices, meanwhile the eSIM Remote Management API is being promoted for landing in international roaming scenarios. This can be widely applied in the consumer market and the IOT market|     |
