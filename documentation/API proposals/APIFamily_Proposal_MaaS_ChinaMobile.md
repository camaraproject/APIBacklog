| API family summary | **Background:**<br>MaaS (Model as a Services) refers to the packaging of AI models and their associated capabilities into reusable services, enabling users to quickly and efficiently build, deploy, monitor, and invoke models without the need to develop and maintain underlying foundational capabilities.<br><br>**Scenario**<br>**Intelligent Customer Service for Multinational Enterprises:** A Chinese-based multinational apparel company plans to introduce large model technology to optimize its online customer service system that directly faces end customers. Local CSPs (Communication Service Providers) can provide standardized large model services that comply with local data regulations and cultural traditions. These CSPs have connection points closer to users and possess extensive knowledge and experience in local culture, security, and data governance. Through standardized APIs, these capabilities can be directly utilized by multinational enterprises or application developers for rapid reuse.<br><br>**Input params**<br>N/A<br><br>**Output params**<br>N/A<br><br>**Notifications** <br> N/A <br> |
| Technical viability | Based on the large model capabilities provided by the model provider integrated with the CSPs, it supports the construction of large model applications according to the needs of the developers. | 
| Commercial viability | MaaS offers convenient large model services for users who need simple and quick access to big models.|
