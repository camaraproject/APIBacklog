| API summary |**Description:**<br> This API is built on the concept of “1 platform + 1 set of facial recognition capabilities + N applications” which is based on integration, innovation, and openness.  The target of this API is focus on high-quality facial detection, high-performance face comparison, and multi-modal liveness detection to build a more convenient, efficient, and accurate security barrier. <br><br>**Scenario:**<br> China Mobile Henan Company has developed a dual-channel and high-availability authentication audit service which is leveraging Unified facial recognition service and internal facial recognition capabilities,. Unified facial recognition service has helped improve the liveness facial recognition success rate in the audit process for Henan Company's marketing tools from 50% to 95%, significantly enhancing  efficiency. |
| Technical viability |The facial recognition API is essentially a model service capability. This capability can be packaged in various ways to provide services, so if an MNO has a MaaS platform, our facial recognition API can be provided within it; if not, it can also be integrated into other platforms. 
| Commercial viability | We offer unified APIs, H5, and SDKs to provide facial recognition services across different applications, whether they are on mobile apps or mini-programs.|
