# API Proposal Template

This template captures all the information that a partner should fill out when proposing a new API (or API family) to CAMARA.

### API family name

CAMARA TrustWorthiness INTENT API.

### API family owner

National Centre for Scientific Research Demokritos (NCSRD)
and Infolysis P.C.

### API summary

A Trustworthiness Intent API enabling developers and applications to request and
monitor trust guarantees (security, privacy, reliability, resilience,safety) as
high-level intents without specifying low-level configurations.

### Technical viability

No network/cloud capabilities required. The API's bussiness logic is supported through an open-source
AI-native trust orchestrator acts as the backend to produce trust scores to feed them in the correspondent network.

### Commercial viability

An open-source implementation is used called Cognitive Coordinator (CoCo), that is, an AI-native trust orchestrator.
It interprets user trust intents expressed in natural language and translates them into actionable system configurations,
dynamically computing a Level of Trustworthiness (LoT) that aligns with both semantic intent and real-world resource constraints.

This is part of the SAFE-6G European Horizon project. (https://safe-6g.eu/)

### YAML code available?

YES

### Validated in lab/productive environments?

YES, lab network.

### Validated with real customers?

NO

### Validated with operators?

NO

### Supporters in API Backlog Working Group

List of supporters.  
_NOTE: That shall be added by the Working Group. Supporting an API proposal means that the supporting company must provide at least 1 (one) Maintainer at the time of the Sub Project creation._
