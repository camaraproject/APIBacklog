| API summary | The use case behind this is that the Cambodian government wants to query SIM profiles from each mobile operator securely. To achieve this, they have requested all operators to provide APIs for secure data access. The current API query used to retrieve a subscriber's SIM profile exposes specific personal and technical information associated with a mobile subscriber's account. This includes sensitive data such as the subscriber's name, date of birth, ID card details, and SIM status. While this information is essential for identity verification, service eligibility checks, and account management, the exposure of such sensitive data raises significant concerns about data privacy and security, necessitating stringent controls and safeguards to mitigate potential risks. We are a Cambodian mobile service provider called Cellcard. We have developed this API and plan to publish it under the CMARA project. This initiative aims to establish a common API standard that all mobile communication providers can adopt for similar use cases, promoting consistency, interoperability, and operational efficiency across the industry. Additionally, we had a meeting with GSMA, where they suggested we make a proposal to the CAMARA EKYC project, as this API aligns more closely with EKYC-related initiatives *Additional context* Please find the full API Documentation URL: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zDhR9Ca13O_zyuHGnXNY3bmdwnU2R1L4/view?usp=sharing. |
