| API summary | The Sponsored Data API enables enterprises to sponsor mobile data traffic for specific subscribers, allowing them to access the internet or use applications without consuming their own data allowance.<br><br>This first version of the API is designed for ANY-destination sponsorship, meaning all traffic generated by the user during a sponsorship session is zero-rated. This approach ensures simple implementation and broad applicability across diverse use cases.<br><br>Sponsorship applies to a predefined volume of traffic and for a determined time period, ensuring controlled usage according to the campaign parameters.<br><br>The API may be extended in future iterations to support targeted sponsorship by destination (e.g., domain, IP, service), allowing operators to restrict sponsorship to specific digital services. |
| Technical viability | This initial version of the Sponsored Data API is technically viable in networks that support the provisioning of secondary data offers (Free Units) with zero rating through the Online Charging System (OCS).<br><br>The implementation assumes a sponsorship model based on ANY-destination, meaning no DPI or destination-specific control is required. Therefore:<br><br>The API only requires that the OCS can handle multiple concurrent data balances per subscriber, and apply 0-rating to the sponsored volume.<br><br>Real-time enforcement of the Free Unit usage is handled mainly by the OCS, without the need for complex or customized PCRF/PCF rules.<br><br>An internal API Gateway (APIGW) interfaces with the OCS to initiate and revoke the sponsored offer using secure APIs.<br><br>The solution is compatible with 3GPP Rel-13 and above, assuming basic support for OCS-based data rating and quota management. 
| Commercial viability | The Sponsored Data API enables a wide range of commercially attractive use cases where a third party (e.g., brand, service provider, public institution) **pays for the mobile data consumption of end users** during defined sessions — without requiring destination-specific control.<br><br>Example business cases include:<br><br>- **Marketing and loyalty campaigns**: Companies can offer sponsored data sessions as a reward or incentive, e.g., "Get 1 hour of free internet with your purchase", improving customer engagement.<br><br>- **Onboarding support**: Telcos and digital service providers can offer free data sessions to new users to explore their platform or access help resources, reducing barriers to adoption.<br><br>- **Social or public interest programs**: Governments, NGOs or educational institutions can sponsor general-purpose connectivity for specific populations during critical campaigns or events.<br><br>The **ANY-destination approach** simplifies implementation and accelerates time to market, allowing sponsors to offer a frictionless “free connectivity” experience without defining or enforcing traffic filters.<br><br>From the operator perspective, the API leverages **existing OCS capabilities** and minimal integration, enabling a **fast and low-cost path to revenue** from new B2B segments.<br><br>|
