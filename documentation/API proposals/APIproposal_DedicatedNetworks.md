| API summary | (*This API proposal can be seen as a superset of an existing API, such as the Network Slice Booking API*) <br> Fixed and Mobile Networks offer the capability of separating devices in different (logical) dedicated networks. Multiple of these (logical) dedicated networks can exist on the same physical network. Often, such a dedicated network with a specific performance (e.g. speed/ latency) is only needed for a specific time duration (e.g. one hour) and at specific locations (e.g. the area of a festival), potentially ensured by an SLA. The aim of the API is to request/modify/delete a dedicated network for API consumers with above mentioned characteristics. API consumers shall also be able to handle access to this dedicated network for devices. |
| Relation to other APIs | The relation between the proposed Dedicated Networks API and the QOD API can be seen as following: The Dedicated Networks API focuses on the reservation aspects in terms of “when”, “where” and “what/how much”. The QOD API focuses on a single device or even a single connection of a device and it be complemented by the Dedicated Networks offering. <br>The relation between the proposed Dedicated Networks API and the Network Slice Booking API can be seen as following: The Dedicated Networks API is agnostic to the underlying network realization and allows usage of different mobile and fixed networks. The Network Slice Booking API requires usage of a Network Slice Instance. <br> The relation between the proposed Dedicated Networks API and the Site to Cloud API: The Site to Cloud API focuses on VPN solutions. It is unclear, whether there is a relation or not. <br> The relation between the proposed Dedicated Networks API and the Device Management API is a bit unclear. The Dedicated Networks API includes device activation aspects, controlling whether a device (with a valid SIM) has access to the Dedicated Network or not. The Device Management API influences the Device Subscription State (without defining the meaning of a state).|
| Technical viability | This API relies on a networking feature like the 5G NPN (specifically the PNI-NPN, TS 23.501 Cl 5.30) or the Network Communication Service (GSMA OPG.02 Annex H) which has several realization options such as Slices or APN/DNN. The API also allows to be applied to fixed or any other type of network scenarios. |
| Commercial viability | The need for having a dedicated network with given performance  characteristics for an application is seen as a requirement / use case (?) by different industry verticals. For example, 5G-ACIA ([link](https://5g-acia.org/whitepapers/npns-for-industrial-scenarios/)) and 5G-MAG ([Link](https://www.5g-mag.com/post/5g-npns-for-media-production-collaboration-with-third-party-networks)) have release whitepapers, how dedicated networks can be used within industrial or live video production environments. |
