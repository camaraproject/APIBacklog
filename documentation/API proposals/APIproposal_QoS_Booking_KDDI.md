| API family owner | KDDI |
| API summary | This API adds a booking feature on QoD service. This API offers a programmable interface for developers to request an assignment of a certain QoS Profile to a certain device with some conditions such as start time, duration and location in advance.<br><br>Existing QoD Services, e.g. QoD API and OoD Provisioning API, provide customers with the ability to set certain profile of QoS to an access network connection in real time.:<ul><li>QoD API: the developer wants to set the required QoS profile for a certain period of time, after which the network configuration must be set back to the default one.</li><li>QoD Provisioning API: the developer wants to set the required QoS profile indefinitely, this is, each time that the UE connects to the network, it will use the required QoS profile instead of the default one, until the association is removed.</li></ul></br>But there is another possible use case for QoD, which is not currently supported:<ul><li>the developer wants to give a certain device an right to set the required QoS profile in advance. When the requested start time comes, the network configuration for the device set the requested QoS profile. After the requested period of time for the QoS prodile, the network configuration must be set back to the default one.</li></ul><br>Proposed evolution of the existing APIs is to add support for a new booking feature with following operations:<ul><li>Creating a booking for required QoS profile</li><li>Removing the booking for required QoS profile</li><li>Getting the QoS booking details</li><li>Updating the QoS booking details for a device</li></ul><br>Input:<ul><li>Device</li><li>QoS Profile</li><li>Application server</li><li>Start time</li><li>Duration</li><li>Service area</li></ul>Output:<ul><li> Operation result</li></ul><br>In case of exception such as network failuar, this API notify status change to device. |
| Technical viability | This API can leverage on the existing QoD services such as CAMARA QoD API, QoS Profile API and OoD Provisioning API.|
| Commercial viability | This API adds a booking feature on QoD service. This feature is more convenient for those use cases where a limited network, especially radio, resourece have to be shared by multiple devices simalteneously at the same place. For example, at the event venue, this feature enables end users to apply and secure the connectivity service on "first come first served" basis in advance.|
