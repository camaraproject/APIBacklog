|                                           | **API Scope**<br>This API would be part of the Home Device API Family. The QbD API allows an application developer to create a session with a network operator. The application can then share Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) such as:<br>- latency<br>- jitter<br>- packet loss<br>- bitrate<br>The network operator can monitors these KPIs and determine a QbD score. These KPIs are aligned with the attributes in the [QoS Profile](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/blob/main/code/API_definitions/qos-profiles.yaml) to maintain consistency across CAMARA. If the score ever drop below certain thresholds, an event can be triggered for rapid telemetry collection. The network operator can then determine root cause and suggest corrective actions either to the application or to the network. |

| Technical viability                       | Application developers can use this API to interact with the network. It assumes the network operator exposing this API has a backend to receive KPIs, analyze them, and produce a QbD score. Based on minimum quality thresholds for the application category, the network operator can provide proactive recommendations. The application could also use the CAMARA NetworkAccessManagement for remote control of a [`Device`](https://github.com/camaraproject/NetworkAccessManagement/blob/1c804a5159f67370f005dbf0cc82e5c7e72725f0/code/API_definitions/network_access_management.yaml#L34) at a [`Service Site`](https://github.com/camaraproject/NetworkAccessManagement/blob/1c804a5159f67370f005dbf0cc82e5c7e72725f0/code/API_definitions/network_access_management.yaml#L40) if necessary.                            |
