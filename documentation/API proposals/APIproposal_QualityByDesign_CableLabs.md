|                                           | **API Scope**<br>This API would be part of the Home Device API Family. The QbD API allows a 3rd party application developer to create a session with a network operator. The application can then share KPIs such as:<br>- latency<br>- jitter<br>- packet loss<br>- bitrate<br>The network operator can monitors these KPIs and determine a QbD score. If the score ever drop below certain thresholds, an event can be triggered for rapid telemetry collection. The network operator can then determine root cause and suggest corrective actions either to the 3rd party app or to the network. |

| Technical viability                       | This API is for 3rd party application developers to consume. It assumes the network operator exposing this API has a cloud backend to receive KPIs, analyze them, and produce a QbD score. Based on thresholds for the app, the network operator can provide proactive recommendations. The 3rd party application could also use the Camara NetworkAccessManagement for remote control of a `Device` at a `Service Site` if necessary.                                                                                                                                                              |
