|                                           | **API Scope**<br>This API would be part of the Connectivity Insights API Family. The Session Insights API allows an application developer to create a session with a network operator. The application can then share Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) such as:<br>- latency<br>- jitter<br>- packet loss<br>- bitrate<br>The network operator can monitors these KPIs and determine a Session Insights score. These KPIs are aligned with the attributes in the Connectivity Insights [application-profile](https://github.com/camaraproject/ConnectivityInsights/blob/main/code/API_definitions/application-profiles.yaml) to maintain consistency across CAMARA. If the score ever drop below certain thresholds, an event can be triggered. The network operator can then determine root cause and suggest corrective actions either to the application or to the network.<br><br>Link to [proposal slides](../SupportingDocuments/session-insights-api.pdf). |

| Technical viability                       | Application developers can use this API to interact with the network. It assumes the network operator exposing this API has a backend to receive KPIs, analyze them, and produce a Session Insights score. Based on minimum quality thresholds for the application category, the network operator can provide proactive recommendations.
