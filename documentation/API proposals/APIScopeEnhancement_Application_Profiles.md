# API Scope Enhancement

| **Field** | Description |
| ---- | ----- |
| API name | [Application Profiles](https://github.com/camaraproject/ConnectivityInsights) |
| New API name | Application Profiles |
| Scope Enhancement owner | Verizon |
| Scope Enhancement summary | Application profiles allows application developers to share all the information about their application which would be relevant for network CAMARA APIs related decision making. As part of initial scope within connectivity insights, the application profiles API only accepted input of network quality thresholds. Now based on the requirements as agreed in Edge Cloud API, plan is to extend this to accept resource requirements of the application for deployment of the application in edge cloud zone. <br> Also propose that we should plan for creating a new repo to maintain application profiles API rather than it being within connectivity insights as multiple APIs will be utilizing this API.|
